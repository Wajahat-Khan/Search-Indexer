# Search-Indexer
 This is the search index implemented in c++, uses data structures like maps and sets for independent and efficient storage of words. 
 We have used pugixml for parsing the data and data is being taken from wikipedia dump dataset. 
 Algorithms are then applied for efficient search on sets for words to give their respective page of occurrences.
